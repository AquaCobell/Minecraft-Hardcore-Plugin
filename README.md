### How it works
Whenever someone dies, a new world is created, and every player gets teleported in the new one.
Old worlds dont get deleted, every new world is named after date and time.

### How to Run
Start a new Spigot server, and drag and drop the jar file in your plugins folder.
Default world must be named world. Otherwise it probably breaks.


### How to start all over
Delete all worlds in your server directory including the world folder.
Then redownload the plugin and overwrite the old one in the plugin folder.
restart / start server
